## Running the Applications

### Quick Start

To run all applications simultaneously:

```bash
npx nx run-many -t serve -p shell remote1 remote2
```

This will start:
- **shell** on http://localhost:4200
- **remote1** on http://localhost:4201
- **remote2** on http://localhost:4202

### Development Workflows

The `nx run-many` command with project filters allows you to run only the applications you need, saving system resources and reducing startup time.

#### Full Stack Development

When working across the entire application or testing end-to-end functionality:

```bash
npx nx run-many -t serve -p shell remote1 remote2
```

**Use this when:** You need to test features that span multiple remotes or verify the complete user experience.

#### Shell Development

When working on the host application (routing, layouts, shared components):

```bash
npx nx serve shell
```

**Use this when:** You're developing shell-specific features and don't need the remotes running. The shell will show loading states when navigating to remote routes.

#### Remote1 Feature Development

When building or debugging features in remote1:

```bash
npx nx run-many -t serve -p shell remote1
```

**Use this when:** You're working on remote1 and need to test it within the shell context. This saves resources by not running remote2.

#### Remote2 Feature Development

When building or debugging features in remote2:

```bash
npx nx run-many -t serve -p shell remote2
```

**Use this when:** You're working on remote2 and need to test it within the shell context. This saves resources by not running remote1.

### Individual Project Commands

You can also serve projects individually:

| Command | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `npx nx serve shell` | 4200 | Host application |
| `npx nx serve remote1` | 4201 | Remote1 application |
| `npx nx serve remote2` | 4202 | Remote2 application |

**Note:** Due to the evolve-platformamic lazy loading pattern used in this workspace, remotes are only loaded when you navigate to their respective routes, allowing for flexible development workflows.

## Module Federation with evolve-platformamic Remote Loading

This workspace demonstrates an optimized Module Federation pattern where remote modules are loaded **on-demand** rather than eagerly at application startup.

### How Lazy Loading Works

The shell application (`apps/shell`) uses route-based lazy loading to defer loading of remote entry files until they are actually needed:

#### Traditional Approach (Eager Loading)

In a typical Module Federation setup, remotes are declared in `module-federation.config.ts`:

```typescript
const config: ModuleFederationConfig = {
  name: 'shell',
  remotes: ['remote1', 'remote2'], // Loaded immediately at startup
};
```

This causes all `remoteEntry.js` files to be fetched when the shell application initializes, even if the user never navigates to those routes.

#### Optimized Approach (evolve-platformamic Lazy Loading)

This workspace uses a different pattern found in `apps/shell/src/app/routes/`:

```typescript
// apps/shell/src/app/routes/remote1.wrapper.tsx
import { registerRemotes, loadRemote } from "@module-federation/enhanced/runtime"
import { useEffect, lazy, useState } from "react"
import { REMOTES_CONFIG } from "../config/config"

export const Remote1Wrapper = () => {
  const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Register the remote only when the component mounts
    registerRemotes([{
      name: 'remote1',
      entry: REMOTES_CONFIG['remote1']
    }]);

    // Lazy load the remote module
    Remote1Cmp = lazy(() => loadRemote('remote1/Module'));
    setLoaded(true);
  }, [])

  return loaded ? <Remote1Cmp /> : <p>Loading</p>
}
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reduced Initial Bundle Size**: The shell application doesn't download any `remoteEntry.js` files until the user navigates to a specific route
2. **Faster Time-to-Interactive**: Users see the home page faster because fewer network requests are made on initial load
3. **Bandwidth Optimization**: If a user never visits certain routes, those remote bundles are never downloaded
4. **Runtime Flexibility**: Remote URLs can be configured evolve-platformamically through the `REMOTES_CONFIG` object in `apps/shell/src/app/config/config.ts`

### Implementation Details

The routing setup in `apps/shell/src/app/app.tsx` connects these lazy-loaded wrappers to routes:

```typescript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<NxWelcome title="shell" />} />
  <Route path="/remote1" element={<Remote1Wrapper />} />
  <Route path="/remote2" element={<Remote2Wrapper />} />
</Routes>
```

When a user navigates to `/remote1`:
1. React Router renders the `Remote1Wrapper` component
2. The `useEffect` hook fires and calls `registerRemotes()` with the remote configuration
3. The `loadRemote()` function fetches the `remoteEntry.js` file and loads the module
4. React's `lazy()` handles code splitting and displays the loading fallback until ready
5. Once loaded, the remote component renders

This pattern is particularly beneficial for applications with many remotes or when remotes are large and not frequently accessed.
